Recipe Finder
==============

A simple recipe search using jQuery and Underscore. Click [here][1] for a live version.

Recipes are found by entering ingredients, one at a time, in the search bar.

This project uses Google's [freebase][2] database for recipe data. The recipe database is rather limited so many ingredients or combinations will not be found. ("Egg" is a good test ingredient.)

When more than one ingredient is entered, the query searches for recipes that include all the ingredients requested.
